# Office App

Office App is a web application helping employees of the specific company which uses the hybrid workplace model to quickly reserve desks and rooms in the office.

The idea came up to me from the increasing popularity of the hybrid working model giving employees the flexibility to combine remote and office work. The transition of companies to this hybrid approach will require a tool allowing employees to book a desk and rooms for certain days when they are going to work from the office. This tool will help prevent office over-booking by reserving desks and rooms by employees and improve teamwork by displaying desks booked by teammates from the same departments.

This app allows users to manage various office facilities such as desks and rooms. Users can book facilities for today or in advance, check in and out, release bookings, and view a list of available facilities. It includes features to prevent issues like double-booking and displaying outdated information. The app is also mobile-responsive, catering to employees who need to book desks and rooms on the go using their mobile devices.

Office App utilizes Django on the back-end, JavaScript on the front-end, and Bootstrap library making this app **mobile-responsive**.

# Features

### Desk booking

User can:

- Find the perfect desk by filtering desks by amenity and floor
- See how many desks are available and occupied as per selected filters
- See desks booked by teammates for today (teammate is a peer from the same department as a user)
- See desks booked by colleagues from other departments for today, and see the department to which colleagues belong to
- Click on the free desk to book it for a whole day. When a user clicks on the same desk again, this booking is canceled. When a user clicks on the desk the app checks the current status of the desk (free/reserved) and shows an error if someone has already booked this desk.
- Book a desk for any date in the future in advance when clicking on the date in the calendar. The web app automatically assigns the first free desk for a specific date.
- See the updated number of available and occupied desks immediately after booking
- Check in on the day when a desk is booked, release the desk on any day before check-in, free up the desk at any time after check-in is made
- See all desks booked in advance

### Room booking

User can:

- Find the perfect room by filtering by the duration of the booking, max room capacity, amenity and floor
- Click on the date in the popup calendar to show rooms and available time intervals for a specific date
- See how many rooms are available and occupied as per selected filters
- See available time intervals for each room based on the duration selected by a user. The application checks all possible intersections of already booked intervals, finds a total period when the room is free, then split it into intervals as per preferred by user duration.
- Click on the available time interval to book a room. Once the room is booked, a user is redirected to the page with all booked rooms.
- Check in on the day when a room is booked, release the room on any day before check-in, free up the room at any time after check-in is made
- See all rooms booked in advance
